THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN TO 7.4%, YET THESE POSITIVE TRENDS ARE OVERSHADOWED BY PERSISTENT LABOR VIOLATIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH (OSH) DEFICITS.BRAZIL IS RECOGNIZED INTERNATIONALLY FOR ITS EFFORTS TO COMBAT CHILD LABOR, HAVING RATIFIED KEY ILO CONVENTIONS AND INTEGRATED THEM INTO DOMESTIC LAW. HOWEVER, CHILD LABOR REMAINS A CRITICAL ISSUE, WITH 1.9 MILLION CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS ENGAGED IN WORK IN 2022, MANY INVOLVED IN HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES PROHIBITED BY BRAZILIAN LAW AND PARTICULARLY AFFECTING GIRLS AND BLACK OR MIXED-RACE CHILDREN.FORCED LABOR CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN, WITH OVER 63,000 WORKERS RESCUED SINCE 1995, AND A WORRYING INCREASE IN CASES IN 2023. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE EXPLOITED IN FORCED LABOR ARE MIXED-RACE MEN IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, OFTEN LACKING BASIC EDUCATION. THIS ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENT NEED FOR IMPROVED LABOR INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT.SUPPLY CHAINS IN BRAZIL FACE SIGNIFICANT RISKS DUE TO THESE LABOR VIOLATIONS, WHICH THREATEN BOTH DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE RELATIONS. WHILE BRAZIL HAS ESTABLISHED NATIONAL GUIDELINES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CRITICISMS PERSIST REGARDING THE VOLUNTARY NATURE OF THESE REGULATIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS, NEW LEGISLATION IS BEING PROPOSED TO CREATE BINDING GUIDELINES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES, THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION (ILO) AND VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS, HAS IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF TRIPARTITE PACTS ( PACTOS ) AIMED AT IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS ACROSS SUPPLY CHAINS. THESE INITIATIVES, WHICH STARTED IN SECTORS SUCH AS WINE AND COFFEE, AIM TO PROMOTE DECENT WORK, FORMALIZE EMPLOYMENT, AND ERADICATE CHILD AND FORCED LABOR.THE ILO WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENHANCE THESE PACTS, FOCUSING ON BUILDING CAPACITY, FOSTERING SOCIAL DIALOGUE, AND INTEGRATING LOCAL VOICES INTO NATIONAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. THE PROJECT WILL EMPHASIZE A SUPPLY CHAIN APPROACH TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF ITS INTERVENTIONS, TARGETING AT LEAST THREE SUPPLY CHAINS WITHIN BRAZIL S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. KEY ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE ESTABLISHING A TECHNICAL SECRETARIAT TO OVERSEE THE PACTS, CONDUCTING ASSESSMENTS OF LABOR CONDITIONS, AND IMPLEMENTING TARGETED ACTIONS TO IMPROVE OSH STANDARDS AND ELIMINATE LABOR VIOLATIONS.THE PROJECT AIMS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF LABOR STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT (MTE), TO ROBUSTLY IMPLEMENT THESE PACTS AND PROMOTE DECENT WORK. BY ENGAGING WITH CIVIL SOCIETY, LOCAL INSTITUTIONS, AND WORKERS  ORGANIZATIONS, THE PROJECT WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS AND PERSPECTIVES OF VULNERABLE AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS ARE ADDRESSED. A PILOT PROJECT WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT LABOR POLICIES, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO EXPAND SUCCESSFUL MODELS TO OTHER SUPPLY CHAINS.THIS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH SEEKS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN LABOR PRACTICES ACROSS BRAZIL, ALIGNING WITH GLOBAL STANDARDS AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE ERADICATION OF CHILD AND FORCED LABOR."

THE RECENT CIVIL UNREST AND THE SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION IN AUGUST 2024, HAS UNDERSCORED THE PRESSING NEED FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. THE FORMATION OF AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT PRESENTS BOTH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS LONGSTANDING ISSUES WITH WORKERS RIGHTS AND LABOR ISSUES.

EMPOWERING TRADE UNIONS TO EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARD WORKERS  RIGHTS IS CRITICAL IN ENSURING A JUST AND EQUITABLE LABOR MARKET. THE READY-MADE GARMENTS (RMG) SECTOR PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THIS REGARD, AS IT IS THE LARGEST FORMAL SECTOR OF EMPLOYMENT, WITH AROUND 4 MILLION WORKERS, AND CONTRIBUTED 10.35% OF GDP IN 2023.DESPITE NOTABLE PROGRESS IN WORKING CONDITIONS SINCE THE RANA PLAZA TRAGEDY, BANGLADESH CONTINUES TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN LABOR MARKET GOVERNANCE. THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE WEAK LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORKS, INEFFECTIVE LABOR INSPECTION SYSTEMS, AND LIMITATIONS ON FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION (FOA) AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING (CB) RIGHTS. THE SITUATION IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY INSUFFICIENT TRIPARTISM, GENDER DISPARITIES IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, AND LOW TRADE UNION DENSITY (11.9%), ALL OF WHICH UNDERMINE BANGLADESH S GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS AND RISK THE LOSS OF PREFERENTIAL MARKET ACCESS POST LDC GRADUATION. IN ADDITION, THE LACK OF REGULAR DATA ON THE TRADE UNION DENSITY AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING COVERAGE IS A KEY CONSTRAINT IN UNDERSTANDING THE OVERALL SITUATION OF FOA AND CB RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY BASED ON SUCH QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE AND BUILDING UP CAPACITY IN THIS REGARD WOULD BE CRUCIAL FOR THE FUTURE.THE URGENCY OF ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY THE ONGOING ARTICLE 26 COMPLAINT OF NON-OBSERVANCE OF RATIFIED ILO CONVENTIONS0F1, RAISED BY WORKER DELEGATES AT THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR CONFERENCE IN 2019. THIS COMPLAINT PROMPTED THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH (GOB) TO COMMIT TO A SERIES OF LABOR SECTOR REFORMS THROUGH THE ILO GOVERNING BODY (GB) ROADMAP (2021-2026) AND THE NATIONAL ACTION PLAN (NAP) FOR THE LABOR SECTOR (2021-2026).THE PROJECT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF A BROADER, COORDINATED EFFORT BY THE ILO, THE GOB, AND WORKERS  AND EMPLOYERS  ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE DECENT WORK IN BANGLADESH. THE PROJECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING OVERALL WORKING CONDITIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOGUE MECHANISMS FOR WORKERS IN GARMENT FACTORIES THROUGH BETTER WORKS FACTORY ENGAGEMENT MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES ASSESSMENT, ADVISORY, AND TRAINING SERVICES. THE PROJECT AIMS TO CAPACITATE ENTERPRISE-LEVEL TRADE UNIONS IN BETTER WORK-REGISTERED FACTORIES TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS AND ESTABLISH AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR IMPROVED FOA AND CB. WORKING IN TANDEM WITH BROADER ILO INITIATIVES, BETTER WORK WILL USE THE KNOWLEDGE AND EVIDENCE GENERATED FROM THIS PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN SOUND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AT THE SECTORAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS. THE OUTCOMES OF THE PROJECT WILL PROVIDE 4VALUABLE EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS THAT CAN IDEALLY BE REPLICATED ACROSS OTHER INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN BANGLADESH, FURTHER ENHANCING THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THESE EFFORTS.THIS PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO BETTER WORK BANGLADESHS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT, RESPECTFUL OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ALIGNING ITS EFFORTS WITH THE ILOS WORK TO PROMOTE THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS (UNGPS) AND THE ILOS MNE DECLARATION.ALIGNED WITH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORKS, INCLUDING THE 8TH FIVE YEAR PLAN (FYP) AND THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION FRAMEWORK (2022-2026), THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO THE PURSUIT OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) BY 2030."

1) STRENGTHENED WORKER VOICE IN UZBEKISTAN'S COTTON CLUSTER SUPPLY CHAINS;
2) INCREASED COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS BY BUSINESSES IN UZBEKISTAN'S COTTON CLUSTER SUPPLY CHAINS;
3) INCREASED DIALOGUE AMONG STAKEHOLDERS TO PROMOTE THE ADOPTION OF TRANSPARENT MARKET AND GOVERNANCE NORMS AND WORKER-DRIVEN SYSTEMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN UZBEKISTAN'S COTTON CLUSTER SUPPLY CHAINS.

DELIVERABLES
AS A RESULT OF PROJECT INTERVENTIONS:
 - WORKERS IN THE COTTON SECTOR WILL INCREASE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE RIGHTS THEY HAVE, INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY TO TAKE COLLECTIVE ACTION TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS AND ACCESS NEWLY CREATED MECHANISMS AT THE WORKSITE LEVEL TO HELP THEM SET AND ENFORCE LABOR CONDITIONS IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND LOCALIZED NEEDS.
 - EMPLOYERS IN THE COTTON SECTOR WILL INCREASE THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LABOR RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL COMPLIANCE STANDARDS EXPECTED BY HIGH-END BRANDS, DEVELOP NEW COMPLIANCE STANDARDS FOR UZBEK COTTON PRODUCERS IN A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS, AND COMMIT TO PILOTING THOSE IMPROVED STANDARDS TO DEMONSTRATE COTTON CAN BE VERIFIABLY PRODUCED ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICES IN UZBEKISTAN.
 - OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS, PARTICULARLY RELEVANT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND GLOBAL BRANDS, WILL PARTICIPATE IN DIALOGUE PLATFORMS THAT ALLOW FOR OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT EXPECTATIONS AND PROGRESS IN TERMS OF SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT, IDENTIFY REFORM PRIORITIES, AND INCENTIVIZE EXPANSION OF REFORM INITIATIVES TO WIDEN DEMAND FOR CHANGE.

THE PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS IN FOUR SELECT SECTORS (RMG, TEA, SHRIMP FARMING, AND CONSTRUCTION) IN THREE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS (SYLHET, KHULNA AND DHAKA) BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF WORKERS TO IDENTIFY AND COLLECTIVELY SEEK REMEDIATION FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING GBVH, AND TO ADVOCATE FOR SAFER, HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. WHILE THERE IS NOT A CATALYZING CATASTROPHIC EVENT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE LABOR CONDITIONS IN TEA, SHRIMP FARMING AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS AS THERE WAS IN THE RMG SECTOR, THE SLOW ONSET EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT EXACERBATE EXISTING OSH CONCERNS SHOULD RAISE SIMILAR ALARM. THEREFORE, THE PROGRAM WILL ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ON WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE DESIGN ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT THOUGH INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND FIRES ARE THE MOST VISIBLE OSH HAZARDS, LESS WIDELY DISCUSSED INDUSTRIAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN HAVE LONG-TERM NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON WORKERS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. COMMON OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES IN THE FOUR TARGET SECTORS INCLUDE MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS, PESTICIDE POISONING, HEAT EXHAUSTION, RESPIRATORY ILLNESS, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUES, AND CANCER. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THESE SAFETY AND HEALTH CONCERNS HOLISTICALLY.  THE SC WILL UTILIZE A WHOLE-OF-COMMUNITY APPROACH (AS EFFECTIVELY PILOTED BY THE SC IN THE RMG, SHRIMP AND FISH PROCESSING, AND LEATHER TANNERIES SECTORS) TO ENGAGE WORKERS, THEIR UNIONS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN JOINT INITIATIVES FOR IMPROVING WORKING AND LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE SELECTED AREAS. THIS WILL INCLUDE COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS, TAILORED TO EACH SECTOR, WHERE PROJECT PARTICIPANTS CAN PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING, SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL OR HEALTH SERVICES, AND HOLD ORGANIZING AND ADVOCACY MEETINGS TO ADVANCE THEIR SHARED GOALS. THE APPROACH RECOGNIZES THAT WORKERS' LIVES EXTEND BEYOND THE FACTORY OR FARM GATE AND THAT WORKPLACE AND PUBLIC HEALTH OVERLAP IN TANGIBLE WAYS.


ACTIVITIES PERFORMED
DURING THE THREE-TO-SIX-MONTH START-UP PERIOD, THE SC AND PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS WILL CONDUCT INITIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN EACH SECTOR (FOUR TOTAL) THAT WILL INCLUDE THE LEADERSHIP OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, WORKER-LEADERS FROM THE TARGET SECTORS, RELEVANT SC STAFF, AND THE PROJECT DIRECTOR. DUE TO THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA SECTORS, THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL REQUIRE 3 DAYS. SINCE THE SCALE OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IS RELATIVELY LESS, THE ASSESSMENT WILL REQUIRE ONLY 2 DAYS. LIKEWISE, AS THE SC HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS IN THE RMG SECTOR FOR DECADES, ONLY 1 DAY IS NEEDED. THE ASSESSMENTS WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATORY ANALYSIS OF THE SECTOR; KEY LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL ALLIES AND DECISION-MAKERS; UNIQUE NEEDS OF MARGINALIZED WORKER GROUPS IN THE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO OSH AND GBVH; AND RELEVANT CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTING TO AND PERPETUATING THE PROBLEMS. FOR CONSTRUCTION, SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA, WHICH ARE NEW SECTORS OF WORK, THE ASSESSMENT WILL INCLUDE IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND WORKPLACES WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS BOTH ACCESS AND POTENTIAL FOR THE GREATEST IMPACT. IN EACH ASSESSMENT, FACILITATORS WILL LEAD ANALYSIS OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES THAT WORKERS FROM MARGINALIZED GROUPS FACE. FACILITATORS WILL USE POPULAR EDUCATION TECHNIQUES TO ELICIT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PARTICIPANTS, APPLYING AN INTERSECTIONAL GENDER ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC NEEDS ARISING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN, GENDER DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS, AND ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN THE PROJECT SECTORS. DURING SENSITIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT GENDER EQUALITY AND GBVH, FACILITATORS WILL DIVIDE FOCUS GROUPS BY SEX TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PARTICIPANTS FEEL SAFE AND COMFORTABLE TO SHARE. THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT WILL IDENTIFY ANY THREATS TO SAFETY FOR ORGANIZATIONS AND WORKERS TAKING PART IN THE PROJECT, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBLE ORIGINS OF THE THREATS, THE DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS ON MEN AND WOMEN, AND THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO MINIMIZE THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS. THE ASSESSMENT SESSIONS WILL INCLUDE PARTICIPATORY STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR PROJECT INTERVENTIONS, DEVELOP SUSTAINABILITY PLANS, AND BUILD DETAILED YEAR 1 WORK PLANS.

DELIVERABLES
THE PROJECT ENVISIONS AN APPROACH TO STRENGTHEN WORKER ORGANIZATIONS AND IMPROVE WORKER KNOWLEDGE AROUND OSH AND GBVH. CENTRAL TO THIS STRATEGY WILL BE INCLUSION OF WOMEN WORKERS, WHO MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE RMG, SHRIMP FARMING AND TEA WORKFORCE, AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM, THE EXTREME MINORITY OF THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. THE STRATEGY IS ARTICULATED IN 6 PARTS, WHICH CORRESPOND TO THE PROJECT SUB-OUTCOMES:
1. EDUCATE: THE INCREASED CAPACITY OF WORKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN ON PROMOTING SAFER, HEALTHIER, AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WORKER ORGANIZATIONS IN EDUCATING AND ENGAGING THEIR MEMBERSHIP. THE SC WILL PRIORITIZE OSH AND LABOR RIGHTS TRAINING-OF-TRAINERS (TOT) IN ALL SECTORS TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO TRAIN WORKERS ON THEIR RIGHTS.
2. REPRESENT: BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF WORKER ORGANIZATIONS TO REPRESENT MEMBERS TO PROMOTE SAFER, HEALTHIER, AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES, INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO TAKE UP WORKER PRIORITIES AND COLLECTIVELY DELIVER REAL CHANGE IN LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS. ACROSS THE FOUR SECTORS, THE SC WILL UTILIZE A MENU OF SAFETY COMMITTEE TRAININGS, GENDER EQUALITY AND GBVH TRAININGS, PARALEGAL CAPACITY BUILDING, AND LEGAL SUPPORT TO ADVANCE THIS STRATEGY.
3. ADVOCATE: THE INCREASED CAPACITY OF WORKERS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVOCATE FOR SAFER, HEALTHIER AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACES AND COMMUNITIES WILL BE CRITICAL TO STRENGTHENING WORKER ORGANIZATIONS AND ADDRESSING OSH AND GBVH ISSUES IN THE TARGET SECTORS. IN CONSULTATION WITH PARTNERS, THE SC WILL UTILIZE A VARIETY OF MEDIUMS (DIGITAL, PRINT, AUDIO, ETC.) AND VENUES (CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS, COMMUNITY HEALTH CAMPS, ETC.) TO MAKE ADVOCACY CAMPAIGNS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE, WHICH IN TURN, INCREASES BUY-IN AND MAKES THEM MORE POWERFUL.
4. ENGAGE: THE INCREASED ENGAGEMENT OF WORKERS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS IN LAW AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION IS KEY TO IMPROVING WORKER ORGANIZATIONS' ABILITY TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE WORKERS' CONCERNS. TO SUPPORT PARTNERS IN THIS AREA, THE SC WILL CONDUCT AN OSH LEGAL AND POLICY GAP ANALYSIS, CONDUCT MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS, AND INITIATE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NATIONAL OSH COUNCIL.
5. NEGOTIATE: THE STRENGTHENED CAPACITY OF WORKERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH EMPLOYERS ON WORKER RIGHTS ISSUES, INCLUDING OSH AND GBVH, IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE WORKER'S RIGHTS CONCERNS, INCLUDING OSH CONDITIONS AND GBVH. TO THAT END, THE SC WILL CONDUCT JOINT MANAGEMENT AND WORKER TRAININGS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING MENTORING. ALL STEPS WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY BROADER UNION CAPACITY BUILDING, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO SUSTAINING THEIR ABILITY TO PROTECT AND REPRESENT WORKERS ON LABOR RIGHTS ISSUES, PARTICULARLY OSH AND GBVH.

THE PROJECT OBJECTIVE IS TO ELEVATE WORKING-AGE WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD OF WORK, PARTICULARLY WOMEN FROM UNDERSERVED GROUPS OR POPULATIONS, IN LIBERIA AND NIGERIA.

ACTIVITIES PERFORMED
THE APPROACH AIMS TO MAKE SPACE FOR WOMEN'S VOICES IN UNIONS AND UNION LEADERSHIP. WOMEN'S VOICES AND INTERSECTING EXPERIENCES WITH DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND GBVH, ESPECIALLY THE EXPERIENCES OF UNDERSERVED WOMEN, IS CENTRAL TO THE SYSTEMS APPROACH. THROUGH CAPACITY BUILDING FOR UNION LEADERSHIP, STRENGTHENING WOMEN'S ACCESS TO AND CAPACITY FOR UNION LEADERSHIP, TRAIN-THE-TRAINER PROGRAMS FOR WOMEN WORKERS ON THEIR RIGHTS AND MALE WORKERS ON GENDER ROLES, THE APPROACH TAKES AIM AT BUILDING KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND BEHAVIORS TO MAKE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE CHANGE. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT ADDRESSING VIOLENCE IN MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS CAN CAUSE MORE HARM THAN GOOD IF MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS THEMSELVES ARE NOT PART OF THE SOLUTION.37F38 BECAUSE LABOR POWER STRUCTURES ARE LARGELY MALE DOMINATED IN LIBERIA AND NIGERIA, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO BRING IN THE VOICES OF MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS THROUGH DIFFERENT AVENUES, EVEN AS SC WORKS TO INCREASE REPRESENTATIONAL VOICES IN UNION LEADERSHIP. TAKING THIS INTO ACCOUNT, THE SC, LED BY THE PROJECT'S GENDER SPECIALISTS, WILL BRING TOGETHER UNION LEADERS AND LEADERS OF ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING AN INTERSECTIONALITY OF WOMEN, IN ADDITION TO REPRESENTATIVES FROM ACADEMIA, RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, AND THE GOVERNMENT, TO CREATE A COALITION THAT BRINGS TOGETHER THE NATIONAL REPRESENTATION NECESSARY TO IMPACT DISCRIMINATION AND GBVH IN THE WORLD OF WORK.

ACTIVITIES PERFORMED
PHASE II OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL COVER INTERVENTIONS AT GLOBAL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL AND IN 5 PRIORITY COUNTRIES. A SIMILAR STRATEGY TO PHASE I WILL BE IMPLEMENTED, CENTERED AROUND EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING PROTOCOL P29, THROUGH THE FOLLOWING FIVE INTERMEDIATE OBJECTIVES (IOS):
1) IO1: INCREASED KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ILO PROTOCOL AND RECOMMENDATION;
2) IO2: IMPROVED AND RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES, ACTION PLANS AND LEGISLATION ON FORCED LABOR WITH STRONG ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS;
3) IO3: INCREASED EFFORTS TO COLLECT RELIABLE NATIONAL STATISTICS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND GLOBAL LEVELS;
4) IO4: WORKERS' AND EMPLOYERS' ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR; AND
5) IO5: STRENGTHENED AWARENESS AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS OF FORCED LABOR.
PHASE II OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL ALSO AIM TO MAINSTREAM THE 'ACCELERATION FACTORS' WHICH ARE THE CORE PILLARS OF THE ILO 8.7 ACCELERATOR LAB INITIATIVE5. THIS INITIATIVE WAS CREATED TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ERADICATION OF FORCED LABOR AND THE ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOR BY OPTIMIZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION INTERVENTIONS BY EMBRACING SIX ACCELERATION FACTORS. THESE ACCELERATION FACTORS ARE BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT CAN EFFECT CHANGE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN A SHIFTING ENVIRONMENT, HELPING ADDRESS GAPS IN PROGRAMMING, WHILST COMBINING BOTH FORWARD-LOOKING INNOVATION AND SCALING OF EFFECTIVE PRACTICES.

DELIVERABLES
SINCE 2015, THE ILO HAS SUPPORTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STRATEGY THROUGH THE USDOL-FUNDED PROJECT ""FROM PROTOCOL TO PRACTICE: A BRIDGE TO GLOBAL ACTION ON FORCED LABOR (THE BRIDGE PROJECT)"". THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING GLOBAL EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE FORCED LABOR BY IMPROVING COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO TACKLE THE ISSUE. THE PROJECT WORKED GLOBALLY AND IN SIX PILOT COUNTRIES - MALAYSIA, MAURITANIA, NEPAL, NIGER, PERU AND UZBEKISTAN - TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENTS, EMPLOYERS' AND WORKERS' ORGANIZATIONS, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. THE PROJECT'S FOCUS WAS TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS AND RATIFICATIONS OF THE ILO PROTOCOL; IMPROVE AND DEVELOP RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES, ACTIONS AND LEGISLATION ON FORCED LABOR; UNDERTAKE RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ON FORCED LABOR; STRENGTHEN WORKERS' AND EMPLOYERS' ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR, AND INCREASE THE AWARENESS OF AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND LIVELIHOOD PROGRAMS FOR VICTIMS OF FORCED LABOR.

THE SECOND PHASE OF THE BRIDGE PROJECT WILL ENABLE THE ILO TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE FIRST PHASE6, WHILE ALSO TARGETING NEW SECTORS, COUNTRIES, AND VULNERABLE GROUPS. PHASE II WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AT GLOBAL LEVEL, REGIONAL LEVEL AND IN 5 PRIORITY COUNTRIES.

THE REGIONAL COMPONENT WILL COVER SELECTED PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES (MARSHALL ISLANDS, PALAU, TONGA, TUVALU AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA), WITH A FOCUS ON PROMOTING THE RATIFICATION OF PROTOCOL 29 AND CONVENTION 29, AS 4 OUT OF THE 7 COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT RATIFIED CONVENTION 29 ARE IN THE PACIFIC. THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, PALAU, TONGA, AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA ALSO APPEAR ON THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS TIER 2 WATCH LIST, FOR THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE IDENTIFICATION OF VICTIMS, AND INSUFFICIENT PROSECUTION AND CONVICTIONS OF TRAFFICKING CASES, INCLUDING THE CASE OF MIGRANT WORKERS TRAFFICKED FOR LABOR EXPLOITATION.

THE PROJECT'S FIVE PRIORITY COUNTRIES WILL INCLUDE THREE FROM PHASE I - NEPAL, PERU AND UZBEKISTAN - WHERE THE PROJECT WILL SCALE UP KEY INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL POTENTIALLY HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THESE COUNTRIES' CAPACITY TO SUSTAINABLY ADDRESS FORCED LABOR. THESE INCLUDE THE RATIFICATION OF THE PROTOCOL AND THE ADOPTION OF A NEW FORCED LABOR LAW THAT WILL PROTECT ALL BONDED LABORERS IN NEPAL; AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL POLICY ON FORCED LABOR AND THE PROVISION OF LIVELIHOOD SERVICES TO VICTIMS IN PERU. UZBEKISTAN WAS ADDED AS A BRIDGE PHASE I COUNTRY IN 2021, WITH ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON ADVOCACY, AWARENESS RAISING AND CAPACITY BUILDING OF LABOR INSPECTORS (IO1 AND IO2). FOLLOWING THE CLOSURE OF THE THIRD PARTY MONITORING PROJECT IN 2022, THERE IS NOW THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT ON SAFEGUARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE IN THE COTTON SECTOR, BY ENSURING A MAINTAINABLE TRANSITION TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE APPROACH, THAT GOES BEYOND THE MONITORING/MEASUREMENT, BASED ON THE REINFORCEMENT OF LABOR INSPECTION (I.E. THE LABOR ADMINISTRATION INSTITUTION THAT, ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, HAS THE MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT LABOR RIGHTS ARE A REALITY AT THE WORKPLACES) AND, THEREFORE, MORE LIKELY TO ENSURE AND ADVANCE THE PROMOTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROVISIONS ON FORCED LABOR IN THIS AND OTHER SECTORS (SUCH AS SERICULTURE/SILK). TO THIS END, THE PROJECT WILL FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF LABOR INSPECTION AND THE CAPACITY OF LABOR INSPECTORS, AND WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE ALIGNMENT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND PRACTICES ON LABOR INSPECTION WITH THE RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL LABOR STANDARDS, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE ILO LABOR INSPECTION CONVENTION, 1947 (NO. 81) AND ILO LABOR INSPECTION (AGRICULTURE) CONVENTION, 1969 (NO. 129).

UNDER PHASE I, PERU AND NEPAL BECAME ALLIANCE 8.7 PATHFINDER COUNTRIES, WHILE UZBEKISTAN BECAME A PARTNER COUNTRY AND IS CONSIDERING BECOMING A PATHFINDER COUNTRY. THE PROJECT'S INTERVENTIONS IN ALL THREE COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR PRIORITIES TO ACHIEVE SDG TARGET 8.7, IN LINE WITH THE PROJECT'S STRATEGY.
THE TWO NEW COUNTRIES THE ILO PROPOSES TO INCLUDE UNDER PHASE II ARE PAKISTAN AND MONGOLIA. NEITHER COUNTRY HAS RATIFIED PROTOCOL 29, AND BOTH HAVE REPEATEDLY REQUESTED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE ILO IN THE AREA OF FORCED LABOR. BOTH HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO COMMENTS OR OBSERVATIONS BY THE COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS ON THE APPLICATION OF CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (CEACR) UNDER CONVENTION NO. 29 DURING THE PERIOD 2019-2020.

IT IS VITAL FOR RESEARCH ON THE ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS (ELSI) OF GENOMICS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN SHAPING PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD GGH. NINETY PERCENT OF THE US PUBLIC BELIEVES IN SOME KIND OF HIGHER POWER AND 55% PRAY DAILY. THE US PUBLIC ATTENDS RELIGIOUS SERVICES AT A RATE 3 TIMES HIGHER THAN SCIENTISTS IN THE US, WHO ARE AT RISK OF MISUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE RELIGION PLAYS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD GGH. FURTHER, BLACK, HISPANIC, AND RURAL POPULATIONS ATTEND RELIGIOUS SERVICES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THE GENERAL US PUBLIC. CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES MAY LEAD TO LOWER LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT OF GGH, WHICH MAY IN TURN CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH DISPARITIES. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHY HIGHER LEVELS OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL INTERVIEW FAITH LEADERS TO IDENTIFY HOW PUBLIC HEALTH GENOMICS MIGHT ENGAGE FAITH COMMUNITIES IN WAYS THAT ARE RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WHILE SOME CONCERNS WITH HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES MAY DISAPPEAR WITH NEW INFORMATION, OTHERS STEM FROM WORLDVIEWS, DEEP MORAL COMMITMENTS, OR MISTRUST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ENGAGING RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY WHICH CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH INFORMATION, WHICH CALL FOR ALTERNATIVE RESPONSES, AND WHAT ALTERNATIVE RESPONSES MIGHT LOOK LIKE. VERY FEW MODELS EXIST FOR GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH ENGAGEMENT WITH RELIGION, PARTICULARLY MODELS THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS VALUE-LADEN CONCERNS.13,14 THIS PROJECT WILL ACHIEVE TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. QUANTITATIVELY EXAMINE WHICH ASPECTS OF RELIGION EXPLAIN ITS INFLUENCE ON SUPPORT FOR GGH ACTIVITIES. WE WILL SURVEY 4800 ADULTS IN THE US TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF RELIGIOUS VARIABLES WITH SUPPORT FOR GGH ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PRENATAL GENETIC TESTING, GENE EDITING, AND MRNA VACCINES. WE WILL GENERATE RICH DESCRIPTIVE DATA AND EXPLORE HOW AND WHEN DIVERSE RELIGIOUS VARIABLES PREDICT SUPPORT FOR, OR OPPOSITION TO, GGH ACTIVITIES. 2. EXPLORE HOW GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH CAN ENGAGE WITH RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE. WE WILL CONDUCT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS VIA ZOOM WITH 180 FAITH LEADERS—30 FROM EACH OF SIX GROUPS: EVANGELICAL, MAINLINE PROTESTANT, HISTORICALLY BLACK, AND CATHOLIC CHRISTIANITY, JUDAISM, AND ISLAM. THESE GROUPS REPRESENT THE LARGEST RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN THE US, COMPRISING 90% OF THOSE WITH A RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. INTERVIEWS WILL EXPLORE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES: WHAT ARE THEIR VIEWS ON GGH ACTIVITIES? IS DIVERSITY OF OPINION ON THESE MATTERS TOLERATED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY? TO WHAT EXTENT ARE CONCERNS WITH GGH ACTIVITIES PRINCIPLED AND TO WHAT EXTENT MIGHT FURTHER INFORMATION BE HELPFUL? HOW MIGHT GENOMIC PUBLIC HEALTH ENGAGE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH RESPECTFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE?"

THIS PATTERN IS NOT UNIQUE TO COVID-19; IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED FOR OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING SEASONAL INFLUENZA. VACCINE HESITANCY, UNDERSTOOD AS A DELAY IN THE ACCEPTANCE OF VACCINATION DESPITE AVAILABILITY OF VACCINATION SERVICES, IS THE PRIMARY ROADBLOCK FOR COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VACCINATION AMONG LATINXS. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS ENDORSED BY THE SAGE WORKING GROUP ON VACCINE HESITANCY, AND PRIOR RESEARCH, ILLUSTRATE THAT INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASE VACCINE UPTAKE IN LATINXS SHOULD ADOPT STRATEGIES THAT: INCREASE VACCINE CONFIDENCE AND CONVENIENCE; REDUCE VACCINE COMPLACENCY; AND RESPOND TO CONTEXTUAL, INDIVIDUAL AND VACCINE-RELATED FACTORS DRIVING HESITANCY, WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND STRUCTURAL RACISM. WHILE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY IN PRIORITY POPULATIONS, THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN COMMUNITY-BASED INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SETTINGS HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED. YET BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, PARTICULARLY WITHIN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS) WHICH TARGET SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, MAY BE AN IDEAL SETTING TO REACH LATINXS, AND OTHER PRIORITY POPULATIONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, TO ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY AND PROMOTE VACCINE UPTAKE. IN COLLABORATION WITH EAST BOSTON NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CENTER (EBNHC), THE LARGEST FQHC OF MASSACHUSETTS, THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL EVALUATE A NOVEL MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING (MI) BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION TO REDUCE VACCINE HESITANCY AND INCREASE COVID-19 AND INFLUENZA VACCINE UPTAKE IN LATINX ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. KEY TO THE INTERVENTION IS THAT THE PROPOSED MI PROTOCOL EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGES CULTURAL VALUES THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE LATINX POPULATION AND THAT IMPACT THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE INTERVENTION HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE FEASIBLE AND READILY IMPLEMENTED IN COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS, AND TO BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG-TERM REGARDLESS OF HOW THE RAPIDLY CHANGING COVID-19 VACCINATION LANDSCAPE EVOLVES. TO RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE THE INTERVENTION, WE WILL CONDUCT A PRAGMATIC MULTIPLE-PERIOD CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED CROSSOVER TRIAL WITHIN FOUR BH PROGRAMS AT EBNHC; KEY TO THIS DESIGN IS THAT EACH PROGRAM SERVES AS ITS OWN CONTROL AND THAT THE MULTIPLE SWITCHES ENHANCE STATISTICAL POWER. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STUDY TO RIGOROUSLY EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BH PROVIDERS IN INCREASING VACCINE UPTAKE AMONG LATINX ADULTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION. KEY TO THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT IS THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ACADEMIA-BASED RESEARCH TEAM AND COLLEAGUES AT EBNHC WHICH, IN TURN, WILL SUPPORT THE RAPID TRANSLATION OF EVIDENCE INTO PRACTICE TOGETHER WITH A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE COLLABORATION AND NATIONAL SCALEUP."
